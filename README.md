# Project: Visualize Sorting Algorithms
## Environment
### Installing Dependencies and Set Up

To install dependencies:

```bash
$ yarn
```

To run tests:

```bash
$ yarn test
```

We have a simple Express server (you can find the code in `app.js`) that is serving up our very basic `index.html` file. We are using webpack to compile all the code in our `src/` folder into one big file.

Go look inside `index.html` to find out what that one `.js` we have compiled all our code into is.

To start the server:

```bash
$ yarn serve
```

To start the compilation process:

```bash
$ yarn start
```

You will need to run `yarn serve` and `yarn start` in separate command line windows/tabs. We would suggest have three tabs in iTerm or Terminal OR creating more terminals in VSCode.
